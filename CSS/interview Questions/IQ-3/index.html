    <h2>Ques. 1.Explain the diff. Btw Relative and Absloute position property </h2>
    <h3>Ans. Relative Positioning (position: relative):

        The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
        It means the element still takes up space in the layout, but you can adjust its position using the top, right, bottom, or left properties.
        If you move it, it won't affect the positioning of other elements around it. <br><br>
        Absolute Positioning (position: absolute):

        The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position value other than static).
        The element is removed from the document flow, meaning it doesn't take up space and may overlap other elements.</h3>
