    <h1>Interview Questions day 2</h1> 
    <h3>Ques. What is box sizing?
    </h3>
    <h4>Ans.  In CSS, the box-sizing property defines how the total width and height of an element are calculated, including padding and borders. By default, the width and height only apply to the content box, but with box-sizing, you can change this behavior to make layout management easier.</h4>

<h3>Ques.What is animation delay?</h3>
<h4>Ans.The animation-delay property in CSS specifies the amount of time to wait before starting an animation. It allows you to delay the start of an animation for a specified period of time after the animation is triggered. This delay is applied to the start of the animation, not its duration.</h4>
<h3>Ques. Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?</h3>
<h4>Ans.To merge cells vertically in a CSS Grid, you can use the grid-row property. This property allows you to specify how many rows an element should span in the grid. </h4>
<h3>Ques.Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid? </h3>
<h4>Ans.To merge cells horizontally in a CSS Grid, you use the grid-column property. This property controls how many columns an element should span across in the grid. </h4>
<h3>Ques.Explain CSS box model </h3>
<h4>Ans. The CSS Box Model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree, which include the following parts:

    Content: The actual content of the box, such as text or images. Its size is determined by width and height properties.
    Padding: The space between the content and the border. It is used to create space inside the box around the content.
    Border: Surrounds the padding (if any) and content. It has a width, style, and color.
    Margin: The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.</h4>



<h3>Ques.what is the difference between display none and visibilityÂ hidden? </h3>
<h4>Ans. display: none: The element is removed from the layout (no space is occupied).
    visibility: hidden: The element is still part of the layout, but it is invisible (space is still occupied).</h4>
